              questions to answer. We have kept 30 minutes for this which is less than that of the real test. You need
              to confirm submission of each question to be accepted by the system. During this online test you can mark
              questions that you want to review later. Once all questions are answered you must submit the final test.
              If you fail to submit on your own, the test will be submitted automatically at the end of allotted time.

    <h3>How to Prepare for the Canadian Citizenship Test</h3>
    <p>
      To become a Canadian Citizen, adults between the ages 18-54 years must pass the Canadian Citizenship
      test unless otherwise decided by Citizenship & Immigration Canada. If you take enough preparation, and
      properly, the test should not be too difficult. In fact, we hope you should be able to pass it in one go. Here
      are a few tips for the preparations:
    </p>

    <ul class="tips-list">
      <li>
        There is an official study guide title &apos;Discover Canada: The Rights and Responsibilities of
        Citizenship&apos;
        provided by &apos;Citizenship and Immigration Canada&apos; from where all questions are asked in the test. If
        you can manage time, go through that book extensively and check your knowledge with the help
        of a friend or family member. Thera are 10 chapters in this guide. Please go through all the chapters
        thoroughly as questions may be generated from any of the chapter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading just the guide as it is may not be enough for everyone. You need active learning to master
        the information properly as the questions are MCQ in nature. Only through active learning and
        practices the information will be registered in our mind.
      </li>
      <li>
        Give special attention on questions which has numbers or dates associated with.
      </li>
      <li>
        If multiple members of your family or friends are taking the test around same time, it is a good
        option to study and discuss together. Then you can ask questions to each other to check your
        progress.
      </li>
      <li>
        Please go through all the tests at click2pass repeatedly and review the answers to understand
        where you are making mistakes. We are confident of your success if you spend reasonable
        preparation from our site.
